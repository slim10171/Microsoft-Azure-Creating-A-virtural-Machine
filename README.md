The second step you want to create your virtual machine, the virtual machine is a virtual computer that allows you to perform task without messing up your main computer. You want to name your virtual machine and also select the same region as you gave your  resource group "US east". Any tabs your not aware of leave default, but you also want to give your virtual machin a iso image which can be windows 10 or any other images that are available. Once you have your image selected you want to click review and create.
